  # Webfishing de_dust port
A port of the de_dust map from Counter Strike 1.6


The map is a direct port of dust from coounter strike 1.6. The area you spawn in has some water to fish in, the quest board, bait shop, and all 3 cabins, with the rest of the map being the normal dust map with no new webfishing additions.

I also made it to where you can get in the water without dying
